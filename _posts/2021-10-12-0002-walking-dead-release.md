excerpt: The walking dead release

Every once in a while Google sends out a friendly reminder that Though About You is in _trouble_, unless adhering to their updated requirements. Usually it's some [required Play store policy change](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9934569). Other times it's a change in the [minimum Android API level](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9859152#targetsdk), [currently API level 30](https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/develop/target-sdk#pre11). Most recently it was a friendly notification that _your Google Play Console developer account requires your attention_ lest it be deleted within a couple of weeks.

While there's no functional change, the new [TAY v1.0.2 is now available](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.thoughtaboutyou.app.android). You may have to give it custom permissions to function properly; if you had already given those before they are hopefully still applied.

If nothing else, this was a small excercise in getting old Android code to compile and run years after the previous update. Let's see how long it'll last -- at least the APK signing key doesn't expire until year 2113!
