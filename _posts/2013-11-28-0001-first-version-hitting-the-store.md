excerpt: After a long wait, Thought About You is finally ready for the public!
---

In case you didn't already notice, Thought About You has finally been [released to the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.thoughtaboutyou.app.android)!

# Features

- Easy to use interface (because the application does almost nothing).
- Colorful interaction (the big button is very red).
- Most importantly: *calls anyone in your phone book, at the press of a big, red button!*

We would appreciate you testing it, providing feedback to us by rating the application. We also have a [public feedback board](https://trello.com/b/1qJa50nv/public-idea-feedback), where you also can post ideas for future features.

# Todo list

- Call out to designers to help us style the look of the application.
