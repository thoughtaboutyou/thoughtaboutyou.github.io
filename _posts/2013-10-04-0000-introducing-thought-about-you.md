excerpt: The introduction to the entire world wide web's most recent project!
---

In a joint project by [Felix Schr√∂der](http://felixschroeder.de/) and [Joel Purra](http://joelpurra.com/) - two techies living in Berlin. During a brainstorming session on Tuesday 2013-10-01, with Leyli A., we figured out a simple phone application to get in touch with your loved ones - with a lot of exciting possibilities. Felix had the initial idea for the app, Joel thought of the name, Leyli had valuable input on the feeling of the service. Felix and Joel continues brainstorming for a few hours more, nailing down some of the initial concepts.

# Todo list
